They may be anywhere in this section unless otherwise indicated. Your objective is to _find_ and _fix_ each of these errors and to include in the report a description of the original error along with the fix. To help your efforts, the oracle has provided you with additional information about the properties of the errors as follows:\n","\n","* _Correctness_ \\\n","Each error causes the code to be strictly incorrect. There is absolutely no ambiguity that the errant code (or missing code) is incorrect. This means errors are not due to the code being inefficient (in run-time or in memory).\n","\n","* _Localized_ \\\n","Each error can be judged to be erroneous by strictly looking at the code (along with your knowledge of machine learning as taught through this course). The errors therefore are not due to the model being uncompetitive in terms of performance with state-of-the-art performance for this task nor are they due to the amount of data being insufficient for this task in general.\n","\n","* _General_ \\\n","Each error is general in nature. They will not be triggered by the model receiving a pathological input, i.e. they will not be something that is triggered specifically when NLP is referenced with negative sentiment.\n","\n","* _Fundamental_ \\\n","Each error is a fundamental failure in terms of doing what is intended. This means that errors do not hinge on nuanced understanding of specific PyTorch functionality. This also means they will not exploit properties of the dataset in\n","a subtle way that could only be realized by someone who has comprehensively studied the data.\n","\n","The bottom line: the errors should be fairly obvious. The oracle further reminds you that performance/accuracy of the (resulting) model should not be how you ensure you have debugged successfully. For example, if you correct some, but not all, of the errors, the remaining errors may mask the impact of your fixes. Further, performance is not guaranteed to improve by fixing any particular error. Consider the case where the training set is also employed as the test set; performance will be very high but there is something very wrong. And fixing the problem will reduce performance.\n","In fixing each error, the oracle provides some further insight about the fixes:\n","\n","* _Minimal_ \\\n","A reasonable fix for each error can be achieved in < 5 lines of code being changes. We do not require you to make fixes of 4 of fewer lines, but it should be a cause for concern if your fixes are far more elaborate\n","\n","* _Ill-posed_ \\\n","While the errors are unambiguous, the method for fixing them is under-specified: You are free to implement any reasonable fix and all such fixes will equally recieve full credit."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fHbr7ltPADIu"},"source":["# Lambda to switch to GPU if available\n","get_device = lambda : \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"K5ryqBE6AJ-t"},"source":["unk = '<UNK>'\n","\n","# Consult the PyTorch documentation for information on the functions used below:\n","# https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html\n","\n","class FFNN(nn.Module):\n","  def __init__(self, input_dim, h, output_dim):\n","    super(FFNN, self).__init__()\n","    self.h = h\n","    self.W1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, h)\n","    self.activation = nn.ReLU() # The rectified linear unit;

It achieves this by processing the input sequence one vector at a time to (a) compute an updated representation of the entire sequence (which is then re-used when processing the next vector in the input sequence), and (b) produce an output for the current position. The vector computed in (a) therefore not only contains information about the current input vector but also about the previous input vectors. Hence, $\\vec{z}_j$ is computed after having observed $\\vec{x}_1, \\dots, \\vec{x}_j$. As such, a simple observation is we can treat the last vector computed by the RNN, ie $\\vec{z}_k$ as a representation of the entire sequence. Accordingly, we can use this as the input to a single-layer linear classifier to compute a yector $\\vec{y}$ as we will need for classification.\n","\n","$$\\vec{y} = Softmax(W\\vec{z}_k); W\\in \\mathcal{R}^{\\mid \\mathcal{Y}\\mid \\times h}$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oFYJdd9kYhXq"},"source":["## Part 2: Rules\n","**Part 2** requires implementing a rudimentary RNN in PyTorch for text classification.

Instead, for the RNN preprocessing function, we replace every word with its corresponding index in the previous word2index dictionary. Then we pad the whole sequence within a matrix [sequence length, index], where sequence length is calculated based on the max length of the sequence in the training data [in our cases, it was 66]. We replace it with the index number for' UNK' for the data that is not included in our word2index dictionary. For the index that is out of each sequence's original length, we padded it with '0'. So during the training stage, the gradient for the '0' vector is always zero. [Because the original word for index '0' is 'a', we replace it with '11832' instead] Thus, all the data is padded with '0', and the vocab length is len(vocab) + 1 for our additional token PAD. When we feed the batch into the net, we first feed it into a word embedding layer (nn. Embedding) to learn its embeddings with an embedding dimension [in our cases, it was 100]. In other words, each word in our sequence will be represented by a vector of size 100. When we train the RNN, we also train these embeddings to represent the word features better.

Batch size is also a critical hyperparameter to tune. Too large of batch size will lead to poor generalization but computational speedups. While a small batch size will lead to slow converge, and can not guarantee to find the global optimal. The learning rate is also essential.
