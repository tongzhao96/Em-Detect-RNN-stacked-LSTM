# Em-Detect-RNN-stacked-LSTM
This is a class project first using a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) and second a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for performing a 5-class emotion detection task.

Implemented an RNN model in PyTorch to predict the emotion of a tweet.

Used GloVe Twitter pre-trained word vetors to create word embeddings, trained the modelon 10,000 tweets.

Achieved ~ 90% accuracy on new tweets
